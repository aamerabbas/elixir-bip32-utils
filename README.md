# BIP32 address utilities for Elixir

If you have a mnemonic seed to generate bip32-compliant wallet, this module will let you get private and public addresses
for various currencies. Right now, I've only added Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it would be easy to extend to others.

This code is just experimental and needs to be refactored/cleaned up.
